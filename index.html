  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Cristina <em>(she/her)</em> and I am currently a student at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/"><strong>Epicodus!</strong></a> This is my first time wading through the sea of code and design. It is quite rewarding, challenging, and fun. I love seeing a webpage transform before my eyes!</p>
    <p>Before starting my journey into programming, I attended PSU for my bachelor's degree in Art History. I have also been working in the Customer Service and Caregiving industry for over 10 years.</p>
    <p>I joined Epicodus because I would like to change my career direction, and integrate my Art History knowledge and researching skills with technology. A couple ways I have begun the process of merging these two fields together is by creating speed painting videos and by managing and editing my mom's <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/RomanianGrandma"><strong>Etsy shop</strong></a>.</p>
    <p>Current interests, hobbies, and skills.</p>
